This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

JSL (JSON Serializable Language) is a network-native functional programming language where all programs and data are representable as standard JSON. It's a Lisp-like language designed for distributed computing with serializable closures and capability-based security.

## Development Commands

### Setup and Environment
```bash
make setup                    # Create venv and install dependencies
source .venv/bin/activate     # Activate virtual environment
make install-dev             # Install development dependencies
```

### Testing
```bash
make test                     # Run all tests with coverage
make test-only               # Run tests without coverage
make test-file TEST_FILE=tests/test_core.py::TestEvaluator::test_lambda  # Run specific test
```

### Running JSL Code
```bash
jsl --repl                   # Interactive REPL
jsl --eval '["+", 1, 2, 3]' # Evaluate expression
jsl program.jsl             # Run JSL file
make examples               # Run example programs
```

### Documentation
```bash
make docs                    # Build and serve docs locally (http://localhost:8000)
make docs-build             # Build documentation only
```

### Step Limiting (Network-Native Feature)
JSL includes step limiting for safe distributed execution:
```python
runner = JSLRunner(config={"max_steps": 1000})
```
- Prevents DOS attacks and infinite loops
- Enables pauseable/resumable computation
- Supports fair resource allocation
- See `examples/step_accounting.py` for network usage patterns

## Architecture Overview

### Core Module Structure
- `jsl/core.py` - Core interpreter (Env, Closure, Evaluator, HostDispatcher)
- `jsl/prelude.py` - Built-in functions (arithmetic, logic, collections)
- `jsl/runner.py` - High-level execution API
- `jsl/serialization.py` - JSON serialization/deserialization
- `jsl/fluent.py` - Fluent API for building JSL expressions
- `jsl/cli.py` - Command-line interface and REPL

### JSL Language Syntax

JSL code is JSON arrays where the first element is the operator:
- Function call: `["+", 1, 2, 3]`
- Lambda: `["lambda", ["x", "y"], ["+", "x", "y"]]`
- Let binding: `["let", ["x", 5], ["*", "x", 2]]`
- Conditional: `["if", ["=", "x", 0], "zero", "non-zero"]`

### String Conventions
- `"variable"` - Variable lookup
- `"@literal"` - Literal string value (@ prefix makes it a string literal)
- `"@/path"` - File paths in host interactions

### CRITICAL: Quoting and String Literal Semantics
**This is a common source of confusion - pay careful attention:**

1. **In regular JSL expressions:**
   - `"foo"` = symbol lookup (looks for variable named foo)
   - `"@foo"` = string literal "foo"

2. **The Quote Operator `["@", ...]` and Its Effects:**
   - The quote operator returns its argument WITHOUT evaluating it as JSL code
   - The quoted data is passed as-is to functions that interpret it
   
   **Example: Where Conditions**
   ```json
   ["where", "products", ["@", ["=", "@price", 50]]]
   ```
   - Step 1: JSL evaluates `["@", ["=", "@price", 50]]` â†’ returns literal list `["=", "@price", 50]`
   - Step 2: This list is passed to the `where` function (implemented in Python)
   - Step 3: The Python function `_evaluate_where_condition` receives `["=", "@price", 50]`
   - Step 4: Python code strips @ from "@price" to get "price" as the field name
   - Step 5: Python looks up item["price"] in each object being filtered
   
   **Why we need the quote operator:**
   - Without quote: `["=", "@price", 50]` would try to evaluate "=" as a variable lookup (error!)
   - With quote: `["@", ["=", "@price", 50]]` passes the list as data to the where function

3. **Where conditions (S-expression format):**
   - `["where", "products", ["@", [">", "@price", 50]]]`
   - The condition must be quoted to prevent JSL evaluation
   - Inside: `[">", "@price", 50]` - operator first (S-expression style)
   - `"@price"` = string literal "price" (becomes field name after @ is stripped)
   - String values need @ too: `["=", "@category", "@tools"]`

4. **Transform operations:**
   - `["transform", "obj", ["@", ["pick", "@name", "@email"]]]`
   - The operation is quoted to pass it as data
   - `"pick"` = operation name (plain string, no @)
   - `"@name"`, `"@email"` = string literals that become field names "name", "email"

5. **Common mistakes to avoid:**
   - DON'T: `["@", ["price", ">", 50]]` - "price" without @ would be a symbol lookup if evaluated
   - DO: `["@", [">", "@price", 50]]` - S-expression format with string literal field
   - DON'T: `["@", ["@pick", "@name"]]` - "@pick" is wrong (not a string literal here)
   - DO: `["@", ["pick", "@name"]]` - operation name without @, field with @

6. **Key insight:**
   - Quoted expressions are DATA passed to Python functions, not JSL code to evaluate
   - The Python implementations decide how to interpret this data
   - The @ prefix convention inside quoted data helps distinguish field names from other values

### Effect System (JHIP)
All side effects go through the host dispatcher:
```json
["host", "@file/read", "@/path/to/file.txt"]
["host", "@print", "@Hello World"]
```

### Key Classes and Patterns

1. **Evaluator.eval()** - Main evaluation entry point, handles all JSL forms
2. **Env** - Immutable environment with lexical scoping via `extend()` and `lookup()`
3. **Closure** - Serializable function objects with captured environments
4. **HostDispatcher** - Manages capability-based host interactions

### Testing Approach

Tests are organized by module:
- `tests/test_core.py` - Core interpreter tests
- `tests/test_serialization.py` - Serialization/deserialization tests
- `tests/test_fluent.py` - Fluent API tests
- `tests/test_runner.py` - Runner module tests
- `tests/test_cli.py` - CLI tests

Use pytest fixtures and parametrized tests extensively. When adding new features, ensure tests cover both positive cases and error conditions.

### Common Development Tasks

When implementing new built-in functions:
1. Add to `jsl/prelude.py` in the appropriate section
2. Add corresponding tests to `tests/test_core.py`
3. Update documentation if user-facing

When modifying the evaluator:
1. Core evaluation logic is in `jsl/core.py:Evaluator.eval()`
2. Special forms (if, let, lambda, etc.) are handled as separate cases
3. Ensure serialization still works after changes

### Important Notes

- The language is purely functional at its core - all mutation happens through the host
- Closures only serialize user-defined bindings, not prelude functions
- The JSON representation must remain valid for network transmission
- Effect reification means side effects are data, not executed directly
- Use `make test-file` for rapid iteration on specific tests during development
